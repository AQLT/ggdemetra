## Overview

ggdemetra is an extension of
[ggplot2](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) to add seasonal
adjustment statistics to your plots. The seasonal adjustment process is
done with [RJDemetra](https://github.com/jdemetra/rjdemetra) that is an
R interface to [JDemetra+](https://github.com/jdemetra/jdemetra-app),
the seasonal adjustment software [officially
recommended](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cros/system/files/Jdemetra_%20release.pdf)
to the members of the European Statistical System (ESS) and the European
System of Central Banks. RJDemetra implements the two leading seasonal
adjustment methods
[TRAMO/SEATS+](https://gretl.sourceforge.net/tramo/tramo-seats.html) and
[X-12ARIMA/X-13ARIMA-SEATS](https://www.census.gov/data/software/x13as.html).

There are 4 main functionnalities in `ggdemetra` depending of what you
want to add in the graphic:

-   `geom_sa()`: to add a time series compute during the seasonal
    adjustment (the trend, the seasonal adjusted time series, etc.).  
-   `geom_outlier()`: to add the outliers used in the pre-adjustment
    process of the seasonal adjustment.
-   `geom_arima()`: to add the ARIMA model used in the pre-adjustment
    process of the seasonal adjustment.
-   `geom_diagnostics()`: to add a table containing some diagnostics on
    the seasonal adjustment process.

## Installation

Since RJDemetra requires Java SE 8 or later version, the same
requirements are also needed for ggdemetra.

``` r
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("ggdemetra")

# Install development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AQLT/ggdemetra")
```

If you have troubles with the installation of RJDemetra, check the
[installation
manual](https://github.com/jdemetra/rjdemetra/wiki/Installation-manual).

## Usage

By default, the seasonal adjustment is made with X-13-ARIMA with the
pre-defined specification “RSA5c” (automatic log detection, automatic
ARIMA and outliers detection and trading day and easter adjustment). If
no new data or seasonal adjustment specification is specified (method or
specification), these parameters is inherited from the previous defined:
therefore you only need to specify the specification once. In the
following examples, the seasonal adjustment will be perform with
X-13-ARIMA with working day adjustment and no gradual easter effect
adjustment (it is the specification that has the most economic sense for
the industrial production index).

To add the seasonal adjusted series and the forecasts of the input data
and of the seasonal adjusted series:

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(ggdemetra)
spec <- RJDemetra::x13_spec("RSA3", tradingdays.option = "WorkingDays")
p_ipi_fr <- ggplot(data = ipi_c_eu_df, mapping = aes(x = date, y = FR)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(title = "Seasonal adjustment of the French industrial production index",
         x = NULL, y = NULL)
p_sa <- p_ipi_fr +
    geom_sa(component = "y_f", linetype = 2,
            spec = spec) + 
    geom_sa(component = "sa", color = "red") +
    geom_sa(component = "sa_f", color = "red", linetype = 2)
p_sa
```

To add the outliers at the bottom of the plot with an arrow to the data
point and the estimated coefficients:

``` r
p_sa + 
    geom_outlier(geom = "label_repel",
                 coefficients = TRUE,
                 vjust = 4,
                 ylim = c(NA, 65), force = 10,
                 arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.03, "npc"),
                               type = "closed", ends = "last"),
                 digits = 2)
```

To add the ARIMA model:

``` r
p_sa + 
    geom_arima(geom = "label",
               x_arima = -Inf, y_arima = -Inf, 
               vjust = -1, hjust = -0.1)
```

To add a table of diagnostics below the plot:

``` r
diagnostics <- c(`Combined test` = "diagnostics.combined.all.summary",
                 `Residual qs-test (p-value)` = "diagnostics.qs",
                 `Residual f-test (p-value)` = "diagnostics.ftest")
p_diag <- ggplot(data = ipi_c_eu_df, mapping = aes(x = date, y = FR)) +
    geom_diagnostics(diagnostics = diagnostics,
                     table_theme = gridExtra::ttheme_default(base_size = 8),
                     message = FALSE) + 
    theme_void()
    
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p_sa, p_diag,
             nrow = 2, heights  = c(4, 1.5))
```

See the
[vignette](https://aqlt.github.io/ggdemetra/articles/ggdemetra.html) for
more details.

Note that `ts` objects cannot be directly used in `ggplot2`. To convert
`ts` or `mts` object to `data.frame`, you can use the `ts2df()`
function. For example, the data `ipi_c_eu_df` used in this package is
obtained by applying the `ts2df()`function to the `ipi_c_eu` data
available in RJDemetra:

``` r
ipi_c_eu_df <- ts2df(ipi_c_eu)
```

‘RJDemetra’ models can also be automatically plotted with the function
`autoplot()`:

``` r
x = RJDemetra::jx13(ipi_c_eu[,"FR"])
autoplot(x)
```
